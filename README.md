# NATIVE vs FRAMEWORK
### Comparison Study

Date: 2023/08

## About

An autoclicker application for Windows designed for a study comparing native vs. framework implementation.

The idea behind this is implement the same application, with the same design, with the same rules using both native technology (WinAPI) and a framework (.NET) 

## Why?

This project was supposed to be part of my studies. Months ago I decided to change my focus in the direction of native compiled languages such as C++ / Rust. I have a personal interest in the Windows environment and believe that an experiment like this could lead me to conclusions that will improve my work capacity when developing complex applications for this operating system.

It is also very valuable to say that there are a lot of non-technical conclusions that could be extracted from this experiment that could be useful for every software engineer. Questions such as the importance of frameworks for software development, why basic principles of computer science cannot be ignored by beginners, and much more.

## Results

When the research is complete, a Medium article will be published with the results.
